                <p>
                Unlock a world of body insights with BMI! Calculate your body fat percentage by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in meters squared. 
                While BMI provides an estimate of total body fat, remember that it doesn't consider muscle mass, bone density, or body composition.  
                Remember that it is always best to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate assessment of your health.
                </p>
                <p>
                <h3>How is BMI calculated?</h3><br>
                To calculate your BMI, you will need to know your weight and height. You can use the following formula: <br> 
                <strong>BMI = weight (kg) / height (m)Â² </strong> <br> 
                Once you have calculated your BMI, you can use the following ranges to determine whether you are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese: <br>
                <br>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Weight status</th>
                        <th id="tablewidth">BMI range</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Underweight</td>
                        <td id="tablewidth">BMI &lt; 18.5</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Moderate</td>
                        <td id="tablewidth">18.5 &#8804; BMI &lt; 25 </td>
                        
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Overweight</td>
                        <td id="tablewidth">25 &#8804; BMI &lt; 30 </td>                 
                    </tr>
                    <tr>

                    </tr>
                </table>
                </p>
                <p>
                <h3>What is a limitation of BMI?</h3><br>
                BMI can provide a general idea of whether you are at a healthy weight for your height. 
                However, it is important to note that BMI is not a perfect measure of health and does have limitations. 
                For example, it does not take into account muscle mass, bone density, or body composition. 
                Plus, BMI calculates overall body fat percentage and cannot quantify the distribution of body fat, which is also considered a limitation.
                Therefore, it should be used as a general guide rather than a definitive indicator of health.
                </p>

                <strong>Conclusion: </strong><br>
                In conclusion, BMI is a useful tool to determine whether you are at a healthy weight for your height. <br> 
                However, it is not a perfect measure of health and should be used in conjunction with other health measures to assess your overall health. <br>
                Remember that it is always best to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate assessment of your health.

            <h2><strong>Percent of Ideal Body Weight (PIBW)</strong></h2>
            <p>
                Percent of Ideal Body Weight (PIBW) is a measure that compares an individual's current weight to their ideal body weight, which is the weight range that is considered healthy for them based on their height, age, and gender. 
                It is often used in clinical settings to monitor the nutritional status of patients, particularly those who are underweight or have experienced significant weight loss.
                Remember that it is always best to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate assessment of your health.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>How is PIBW calculated?</h3><br>
                The formula for calculating PIBW is: <br>
                <strong>PIBW = (Current weight / Ideal body weight) x 100% </strong><br>
                *How is ideal body weight calculated? <br>
                <b>Men:</b> height(m) * height(m) * 22 <br>
                <b>Women:</b> height(m) * height(m) * 21 <br>
                For example, if a woman's height is 172cm (=1.72m), her ideal body weight is 1.72 * 1.72 * 21.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>What can PIBW tell you about your health?</h3>
                <br>
                Percent of Ideal Body Weight (PIBW) is used to gain insights regarding your nutritional status. 
                For example, if an individual's ideal body weight is 120 pounds and their current weight is 100 pounds, their PIBW would be calculated as:
                PIBW = (100 / 120) x 100% = 83.3% 
                In this case, the individual's PIBW is 83.3%, indicating that they are below their ideal body weight and may require additional nutritional support. <br>

            <h2><strong>Waist-to-Hip Ratio (WHR)</strong></h2>
            <p>
                WHR is a measure of your body fat distribution, calculated by dividing the circumference of your waist by the circumference of your hips.
                A high WHR indicates that more fat is stored around the waist, which can be a risk factor for certain health conditions. Remember that it is always best to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate assessment of your health
            </p> 
            <p>
                <h3>How is WHR calculated?</h3> <br>
                To calculate your WHR, you will need to measure the circumference of your waist and hips. 
                You can use a measuring tape to measure the widest part of your waist, and the widest part of your hips, usually at the level of the buttocks. 
                Once you have these measurements, you can use the following formula: 
                <strong>WHR = waist circumference / hip circumference</strong><br>
                
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>How to measure waist and hip circumference?</h3><br>
                Stand with your feet 25-30 cm apart and distribute your weight evenly on both feet. 
                Use a tape measure to measure your waist and hip circumference, making sure the tape measure is slightly loose to avoid compressing the skin. 
                To measure your waist, place the tape measure at the midpoint between your lowest rib and the top of your hip bone. 
                To measure your hip circumference, place the tape measure around the widest part of your hips.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>What can WHR tell us about our health?</h3><br>
                A high WHR can indicate a higher risk for health problems such as heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.  
                This is because storing excess fat around the waist can increase the production of certain hormones and lead to insulin resistance.  
                In general, a WHR of 0.85 or higher in women, and 0.90 or higher in men, is considered to be high and may indicate an increased risk for health problems. <br>

                <h3>What is a limitation of WHR?</h3><br>
                Although waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) are commonly used methods for measuring abdominal obesity, it is important to note that they do not provide an accurate measurement of visceral fat. 
                Imaging techniques such as abdominal CT scanning are more effective in assessing visceral fat.

            <P>
                WHtR is a measure of your body fat distribution, calculated by dividing your waist circumference by your height. 
                A high WHtR indicates that more fat is stored around the waist, which can be a risk factor for certain health conditions.

            </P>
            <p>
                <h3>How is WHtR calculated?</h3><br>
                To calculate your WHtR, you will need to measure the circumference of your waist and your height. 
                You can use a measuring tape to measure your waist at the level of your belly button, and your height without shoes on. 
                Once you have these measurements, you can use the following formula: <strong>WHtR = waist circumference / height</strong> <br>
                
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>What can WHtR tell you about your health?</h3><br>
                A high WHtR can indicate a higher risk for health problems such as heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. 
                This is because storing excess fat around the waist can increase the production of certain hormones and lead to insulin resistance. 
                The advantage of WHtR is the use of waist circumference. Health issues related to obesity are closely related to visceral fat, and waist size can indirectly measure visceral fat. 
                In general, a WHtR of 0.5 or higher is considered to be high and may indicate an increased risk for health problems. <br>
